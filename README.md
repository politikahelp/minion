A CLI tool to help with some random tasks with the politikahelp project.

Install globally with:

```
npm install -g @justinc/politikahelp-minion
```

Use:

```
$ minion --help
```

Currently, the app is published under the scoped name of `justinc`.
Even in this scope, I don't want to take the name `minion`, hence the package
name of `politikahelp-minion`.
